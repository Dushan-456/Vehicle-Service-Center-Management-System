# Vehicle Service Center Management System

## Overview
This web application is designed to help vehicle service centers manage their operations efficiently. The system allows the service center owner to add vehicles, maintain service history, and log new services easily. Built with PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, it ensures a user-friendly interface for day-to-day management of vehicle records and services.

  Service owners can add vehicles by entering details such as vehicle model, registration number, owner’s name, and contact information.

## Challenges and Solutions

- **Data Management**:  
  Managing a large amount of data related to vehicle services required careful database structuring. I implemented efficient database queries and indexed tables to optimize performance.
  
- **User Interface**:  
  Creating a responsive and user-friendly design was essential. I used Bootstrap to ensure the interface worked well across devices and was easy to navigate.
