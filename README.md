# Vehicle Service Center Management System

## Overview
This web application is designed to help vehicle service centers manage their operations efficiently. The system allows the service center owner to add vehicles, maintain service history, and log new services easily. Built with PHP, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, it ensures a user-friendly interface for day-to-day management of vehicle records and services.

## Key Features

- **Vehicle Management**:  
  Service owners can add vehicles by entering details such as vehicle model, registration number, owner’s name, and contact information.

- **Service History**:  
  Owners can view the complete service history of each vehicle, including past services, dates, and types of service performed. This helps in tracking and maintaining the vehicle’s service records efficiently.

- **Add New Service**:  
  The system allows the addition of new service records, including details like service type, parts replaced, labor cost, and next service date.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP (with server-side form validation)
- **Database**: MySQL (for storing vehicle and service data)
- **Version Control**: Git (GitHub)



## Challenges and Solutions

- **Data Management**:  
  Managing a large amount of data related to vehicle services required careful database structuring. I implemented efficient database queries and indexed tables to optimize performance.
  
- **User Interface**:  
  Creating a responsive and user-friendly design was essential. I used Bootstrap to ensure the interface worked well across devices and was easy to navigate.
